# Universal Artsy Expo
Porting Artsy iOS App to Android &amp; Web<br/>
The Artsy app is comprised of 2 major projects: [Eigen](https://github.com/artsy/eigen) (iOS App)
and [Emission](https://github.com/artsy/emission) (React Native components).<br/>
Based on this invaluable foundation, this project aims to bring the Artsy universe to the other 2 major platforms.<br/>
The web port will be based on [React-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)
and [React-native-dom](https://github.com/vincentriemer/react-native-dom)<br/>
This project is developed with the wonderful [Expo](https://expo.io/) toolchain<br/>
